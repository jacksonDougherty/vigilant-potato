\subsection*{Problem}

There are two traitors in the royal household. Thufir Hawat must determine which two are the traitors of Lady Jessica, Dr. Wellington Yueh, Gurney Halleck, and Duncan Idaho. Luckily, traitors always lie and non-traitors always tell the truth.

Thufir interrogates each suspect. Jessica says she is not the traitor, and Wellington says he is not the traitor. Gurney says that Jessica or Wellington is a traitor, and Duncan says that Jessica or Gurney is a traitor. Thufir notes that $OR$ differs from $XOR$.
